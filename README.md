# ODE-Solver
Solves an ODE with boundary values using a Bezier cure.

# Introduction

A collocation method can be used to solve a boundary volue problem using a Bezier curve, in a cannonical way with great accuracy. In this project, I attempted to test this mehod using a quadratic Bezier curve with mixed results. I did find that Bezier curves made it much easier to approximate a BVP, but also that without minimizing some approximated error, the error is too large to use my program to seriously solve BVP's.
